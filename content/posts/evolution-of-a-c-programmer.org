#+TITLE: Evolution of a C Programmer
* Evolution of a C Programmer
In the same spirit as these famous posts for [[https://cspages.ucalgary.ca/~robin/class/449/Evolution.htm][haskell]] and [[https://erkin.party/blog/200715/evolution/][scheme]], I'd like to do
the same for C, and factorial is as a good an example program as any for it.

;; Studying K&R

;; Studying the *original* K&R
;; (use the old implicit int and weird argument type declarations)

;; Coming from C++

;; Coming from rust
;; (stdint types only)

;; Coming from assembly
;; (only uses while loops, declares unitialized variables)

;; C2x enjoyer

;; Hates C, just wants to get this over with
;; (system calls to shell commands)

;; idk, abuses the macro system to make algol out of { and }
