  - chat app that acts as a fish front end with the ability to drop into a small llm trained on fish & unix
  - rationale: people are afraid of terminals but they can be friendly, and no one‚Äôs afraid of text interfaces for chat apps, so what if the terminal -was- a chat app between you and the kernel?

*** Yuccalisp (8-bit LISP 1.5)
  - Steps:
    - GC:
      - LFSR-based PRNG
      - Linked list
      - use RNG for list-structured memory (even out mem access times)

    - Accept keyboard input
    - Read-Print loop prompt
    - Tokenizer:
      - regexp?
      - something simpler?
    - Parser
    - Eval-Apply
** Pre-SiFive Dev Ideas
*** Tranalytics.gay
  - Build with streamlit and pandas
  - Beautiful soup to scrape the prices of estradiol synthesis from chemical manufacturers
    - Estrone
    - Lithium Aluminum Hydride
    - Calcium Hydride
    - Sodium Borohydride
  - Start with -just- Œ≤-estradiol prices and availability from the top 10 chemical manufacturers (figuring that out is its own question), then add in the precursors
  - MVP version (0.1.0):
    - Scrape the price of -just- estradiol powder, at -just- 1 company (Sigma or Fisher), -just- once a day
    - Add those values to a df and display a line chart (x: time, y: price) on the home page
  - Next Steps:
    - Instead of adding more data, create a rest api so you can grab the df values
    - Make a react app that displays the same chart
    - Port the react app to mobile (android only)
  - Version 0.2.0:
    - Add in more manufacturers
    - Add in precursor chemicals
    - Find a good way to display them (maybe separate pages entirely?)
    - Add an About Page
    - Determine best practices for project management so I don‚Äôt get overwhelmed
    - If it‚Äôs working well, open project up to the public, ask for things that could be done better (especially focusing on the stats/data viz side, since I‚Äôm weaker in that)

*** Scrape from angel.co to see number of jobs by technology
  - Use separate job titles (data scientist, full-stack engineer, etc.) as group factors
  - Hone in on the ones most likely to get me a job
  - Use selenium to input the parameters (don‚Äôt think bs4 can handle this)

*** Pd.js: Pure Data reimplemented in JS with the webaudio api
  - React
  - Note: this would be a huge project

*** Tarot app
  - More interesting than standard cards
  - Maybe program old Italian games that actually used them back in the day?

*** arewetcoyet.com
  - check tail call optimization of browsers

*** User-friendly Array Language
  - do to APL or J what Jos√© Valim did to Erlang
  - Maybe just port an existing language over to an array-based core?

*** React Native Pocket Operator, PK-83
  - Keep the same interface as the PO-20 except:
    - no game & watch display
    - no knobs
    - instead fill space with name & 2 sliders
    - (maybe xy pad instead?)
    - FM instead of 8-bit sounds
    - Black & Grey with Teal, Peach highlights

*** Other PK series
  - PK-94 sampler
  - PK-60 Juno

*** Write a Common Lisp compiler in Rust (or zig)
  - Definitely start with a Scheme compiler
  - Make it a modernized superset of SBCL-compatible CL (bake in the functional stuff and nice data types from Alexandria and Serapeum)

*** Insufferable "Boymoder & Bl√•haj" platformer on the NES/tic-80/Pico-8

*** Gameboy Color Lisp editor
  - Pokemon style menu interface with keywords clustered into common types
    - I/O
    - Conditionals
    - Def and Set\!
    - Math
    - Lists
    - Recently used
  - Global taskbar at the bottom, prompt right above that
    - Commands
    - Keyboard
    - Status
    - Options?
  - Maybe something really terse like APL or Forth would be better?

*** Create 8 bit SoC with Chisel:
  - First prototype: model after either the Z80 or 6502, something well-documented

*** Fantussy, Fantasy Console game engine for Atari 8 bit

*** Snake% various programming languages
  - how fast can you make a functioning game of snake?
  - at least one kind of lisp, and Haskell
