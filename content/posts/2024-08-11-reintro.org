Hi reader! This is yet another blog update, hopefully one that shouldn't look
too different but bring some important changes under the hood.

Most notably: RSS support!

* What does this mean for me reading this?

It means you can use any rss reader app (and if you're on android I highly
recommend [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play&hl=en&gl=US][Feeder]], but any should work) to keep up with my posts here :)

Why does that matter? It means you can get a push notification without either
of us needing to rely on a megacorporation ;P
