* Learning Lisp when you don't know programming

For some reason, lisp gets the reputation of being weird and incomprehensible
to even other computer people, so I found it surprising how...easy and
approachable it was? Like, even compared to object oriented code that's
considered much more typical and familiar to programmers. Idk, maybe I'm the odd
one in seeing all the syntax and brackets
